# Portfolio
  
This website will be a portfolio for my projects.  
I imagine it will include the following:

- Work experience
- Education
- Light/dark mode
- Small about-me section

## Main section

- Filters/multi-selects to filter down github projects
- Example: name filter, tag filter, date, and language
  - Deeper filters could include things like what it was developed for, i.e. which minecraft server, or type of server
- Each project will display in a list of "cards" with the About section displayed under it (should have github icon for link).
- Upon clicking the project name, the README -- or some more info at least -- will display along with a link to the GitHub repository
